# SimpleNotePad

**SimpleNotePad** is a very simple and minimalist HTML/CSS/JS/PHP application that does exactly one thing: provide a quick and dirty notepad!

You just type what you need to write down, and it instantly saves the text in a file on your server.

It can be useful, for example, when you just need a very quick way to share a link or a piece of text from your mobile to your computer and vice versa.

It serves exactly one note, it's single-user oriented and doesn't offer any authentication mechanisms, so you'd better implement HTTP Basic Authentication at least.
